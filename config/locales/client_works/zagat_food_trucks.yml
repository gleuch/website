      about: |
        Zagat wanted to build a web site application that would track the locations of food trucks and allow visitors to filter search results through cuisine, Zagat rating, and proximity. What we delivered was a great, full-screen map that integrated with a large number of food trucks to allow hungry visitors to find their nearby favorite food trucks.

      solution: |
        One of the biggest challenges to solve is getting food trucks to announce their openings and locations. With all the available technologies, we chose to have food trucks send out a location-aware tweet. These tweets were scraped through Twitter's API, determined their open status, a location derived from their plan, and marked on a map. However, some food trucks had semi-permanent locations, in which a online schedule was built to accommodate those food trucks.
        
        In the end, over 30 food trucks in NYC were participating on the launch of the site, attracting attention for its ease-of-use for lunch-time works wanting a great snack nearby.
