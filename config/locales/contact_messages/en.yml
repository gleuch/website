          You're message means a lot to me (and you). No guarantee that I'll buy from your Canadian pharmacy or support your Kickstarter, but if you can spell well enough, I'll get back to you shortly.
          
          You can also hit me on <a href="%{email_url}">email</a> or <a href="%{twitter_url}" target="_blank">Twitter</a> if it is important. Or not. Either way, if you do email or tweet at me, include a <a href="%{good_link_url}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">good link</a> to skim over or an <a href="%{good_gif_url}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">entertaining GIF</a> to watch.
