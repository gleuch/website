      statement: |
        Shaved Bieber is a JavaScript project converted into a browser bookmarklet and Firefox Add-on. This project, capitalizing on the success of Ctrl+F'd, and aims to provide tools to consumers to control, adapt, and modify the contents of the internet from their browser, allowing individuals them to hide content they choose not to see.
        
        Personal censorship is an emerging idea in response to government and business censorship; an approach to providing a free, open, and neutral web that can still be censored by the individual.
        
        The code is an adoption of the Ctrl+F'd project, modified so that only specific keyword matches are hidden from the user.
