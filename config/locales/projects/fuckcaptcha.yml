      statement: |
        fuckCAPTCHA, an open-source alternative to the spam prevention & evil humanization of human brain cycles for corporate pet projects.

      explanation: |
        The founder of reCAPTCHA created their tool to prevent spam and help humanize OCR scanning errors, later noting that he had "unwittingly created a system that was frittering away, in ten-second increments, millions of hours of a most precious resource: human brain cycles."

        In Sept 2009, Google bought reCAPTCHA, assumingly to help with the work of their book scanning project.

        So why support them when you can reaffirm your efforts of enforcing the fuck corporate culture by typing it in for every time to need to verify yourself as a non-evil human.
