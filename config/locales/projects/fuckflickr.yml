      statement: |
        FuckFlickr is open-source image gallery software that won't narc you out. It created it as an alternative to hosting photos on a certain narc-owned photo sharing site.

        No database required; just upload it and put images in the data directory. FuckFlickr will automatically create thumbnails, including animated GIFs and supports themes. Titles and descriptions are easily changed with a single text file in each folder. FuckFlickr also offers RSS feeds, toggleable lightbox, sorting, pagination, caching, and more
