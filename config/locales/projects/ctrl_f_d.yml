      heading:              "Ctrl+F'd"
      subheading:           A playful experiment in "censoring" a web page by hiding text and images behind blocks.

      statement: |
        With recent mistakes by companies and organizations not knowing how to properly censor online documents, its easy to see why people believe the text they can't see can't be read. And with computer illiterate people like <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/200902130016" target="_blank">Rush Limbaugh</a>, it is easy to befuddle them with the appearance of censored text on the web pages they commonly visit.
